Known Bugs:

1) I see the check for "<message name=", "<label name=" and "<widget name=". Lists is the fourth one? Should this be compared as well??

2) The program repeats certain step many times, killing performance. The ReportList checks for dusplicates and does not add 
the same error more than once, but each Report object increments its counter. This value is displayed in the first column. 
This bug should be fixed but doesn ot seem to impact the quality of the error list.
